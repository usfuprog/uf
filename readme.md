 This is a small project, that help can learn foreign language. The main idea of this method:
 1. You have database with english words, and their translation to the language you study.
 2. You want to select some of this words, and create output with method you choose. This output will be used to 
 create mp3 sound files to learn language. 
 3. One of the possible modification of the plain text will be - 
 eng1 IS fra1, eng2 IS fra2, eng3 Is fra3 on line 1
 then, 
 eng1 IS fra1 OR fraX(choosed randomly from all selected words, or from database) on the line2
 eng2 IS fraX(choosed randomly from all selected words, or from database) OR fra2 on the line3
 eng3 IS fra3 OR fraX(choosed randomly from all selected words, or from database) on the line4
 
 This means, computer will take english word, and offer right and wrong translation, randomly on the first or 
 second place. This will activate choices beetween two possibilities in brain, and 
 will made study process more effective. 
 
  With procedure code(without building OOP project, UML diagrams, and comments to each function)
  this functionality can be achive in 20 lines. The main problem of this 20 lines is, that after 3 monthes, it is 
  hard to tell, how they work, and it is hard to extends this code for more functionality. 
  
  Beside this, even in such small project, I want have some start options, like: 
  
 • English words can be choosed randomly(select count before), or choose it manualy. 
 • In true/false choice, wrong translation will be from words that was selected, or from the database. 
 • Choose if output will be on html page, or in text file. 
 • If I create another methods of modification plain text(like one right translation, and two wrong), it must 
  be possible easy add this methods in the project.
